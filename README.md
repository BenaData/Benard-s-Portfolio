>This is a personal project I did to showcase my MS-excel skills

* The purpose of the EDA is to use historical data of the shop to draw valuable insights concerning the brands dealt with to help the management make informed decisions.
* It included pie charts, bar charts and line graphs created with excel.
* I created an interactive dashoard to make it easily understood by stakeholders


# [Project 2: Products suppliers data analytics with MySQL](https://benadata.medium.com/products-suppliers-data-analytics-with-mysql-dc9488c50b8)
>This is a simple project to help me practice MySQL queries for creating tables and retrieving and aggregating data.

* I wanted to use SQL to create products table and load data into MySQL using MySQL workbench. After loading the data, I wanted to run basic SQL querries to get insights from the data.
* The SQL queries used are: CREATE TABLE, SELECT, FROM, LIMIT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, DESC, and AND.

# [Project 3: Income Census Data Analysis With Python](https://github.com/BenaData/Data-Analysis/blob/master/income_census_data_analysis.ipynb)
> This is an exploratory data analysis project for drawing useful insights from income census dataset.

* I conducted simple data cleaning techniques to ensure that the data was complete.
* The goal of this project was to continue following the essential steps of data analysis: Ask questions, prepare data, process data, analyze data to answer questions, and then share insights.
