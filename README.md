>This is a personal project I did to showcase my MS-excel skills

* The purpose of the EDA is to use historical data of the shop to draw valuable insights concerning the brands dealt with to help the management make informed decisions.
* It included pie charts, bar charts and line graphs created with excel.
* I created an interactive dashoard to make it easily understood by stakeholders
